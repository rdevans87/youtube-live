## User Story

```
As a user, I want a channel to stream live music and find information about my favorite artists. When I visit the site, I can search for upcoming concert events and locations, and watch recommended videos based on different categories.

```

## Business Context

Musical Artists and Venue Owners would benefit greatly from making Live Concert Events more accessible to a wider audience. Creating a channel to stream live music would provide a safer and more affordable concert experience for audiences and generate more revenue for both parties. Audiences would benefit from the convenience and flexibiliy of streaming live music from the comfort of their own home with out having to worry about the health risks of an overcrowded ampitheater making it easier for venue owners to maintain covid safety regulations.
